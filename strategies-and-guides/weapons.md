## Choosing a Weapon

The higher the rarity of your weapon, the higher the xBlade payout. Due to the formula adjusting based on your chosen weapon and character, win rate should not fluctuate even if you use a higher rarity weapon and face higher powered monsters.

It is advisable to find a good 4-star or 5-star weapon to begin earning xBlade, depending on your budget, and build a team around that weapon. You may also choose to purchase characters first and find a weapon that fits the team element.

If you cannot buy or mint a 4-5 star weapon, choose a weapon with as high numerical stats as possible for maximum xBlade payout.

## Weapon Element

Because of the Trait Bonus in the combat formula, it is always recommended to use a weapon whose element matches the hero

Using a weapon whose element matches the hero provides a bonus equivalent to choosing a monster where you have advantage against.

## Weapon Attributes

When the element of the weapon matches the character, it comes down to weapon's attributes to decide if it is a good weapon.

The ideal scenario is to get a weapon whose elements and attributes all match the character, and all attributes having high numerical values. Such weapons are valued very highly, and can get quite expensive on the marketplace.

When operating on a budget, some concessions have to be made regarding weapon choice.

Other than matching the weapon element to the character, it is recommended to choose a weapon with high numerical stats, regardless of elemental matching.

A high numerical stat total results in higher xBlade payout per fight, and the win rate impact of having unmatched stats can be mitigated if the player makes optimal choices in combat.

Different rarities of weapons have different minimum and maximum attribute value totals. The minimum and maximum total attributes for weapons above 3-star are listed below:

* 3-star : 280 - 400
* 4-star : 400 - 800
* 5-star : 804 - 1200
{% endhint %}

If a character is selected when choosing a weapon, users may find that deciding based on percentage is a better option if they wish to consider win rate.

The percentage value of the weapon takes into account the character element, so choosing a high total percentage will lead to a weapon that has a high xBlade payout and a high win rate.

Similar to the numerical values, percentages also have different minimums and maximums. The values for total percentages of 3-star weapons and above are listed below:

* 3-star : 70% - 107%
* 4-star : 100% - 214%
* 5-star : 201% - 321%
{% endhint %}

## Weapon Choice Conclusions

Based on the above information, we can make several key decisions in choosing our weapon.

* Always use a weapon that matches the character's element.
* Choose a weapon with as high numerical stats as possible for maximum xBlade payout.
* Try and match a weapon's attribute element with the character's element for an increase in win rate.
