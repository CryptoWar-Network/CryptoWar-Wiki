# Characters

## Your First Character/s

To start the money making journey, you may mint your first hero and receive a free 1-star weapon to go with it. You can mint four characters but it is not likely they are the same element and since you want your heros to be able to use a strong good weapon, one of the best option is purchasing them on market place or you can keep minting, selling other hero that is not associated with the element you need \( for example you have a Fire sword and want to have 4 Fire hero \)

A better option assuming you have sufficient capital is purchasing leveled characters as experience is a resource that costs time to obtain.

Purchasing characters can be a good way to get a head start, but don't disregard the weapon.

Suggestions on weapon purchases can be found in their respective section in the Strategies and Guides group.

## Mono Element Composition

If you obtain a good 4-star or 5-star sword of any particular element, it might be beneficial to try and obtain four characters of the same element so they can all share and use that one good sword. Minting a character is the cheapest way to get one, however the current state of the game incentivizes a mono-element team as having four characters of the same element can allow you to leverage just a single amazing sword.

## When to claim experience ?

Level milestones are the most important aspect in managing character experience.

Be sure to take note of when your characters are about to hit the next milestone, and if a character has crossed that threshold refrain from fighting with them before claiming their experience.

It is also recommended to batch experience claims to minimize gas fees spent on claiming, as each transaction incurs a fee.
