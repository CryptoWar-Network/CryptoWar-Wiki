# Rewards

The player receives two types of rewards when they successfully defeat an opponent, xBlade and character experience. The xBlade reward is dependent on the power of the enemy defeated. At the time of the writing of this wiki, the formula is 0.111627 \(awarded as a gas offset\) + .014651 per 1000 power of the enemy defeated. Experience earned is assigned to the character that won the battle.

 The xBlade and experience earned are stored until the player initiates a transaction to move the xBlade to their wallet and to apply the experience to their characters. This feature has been added to reduce the amount of gas the player requires to play the game. 

Note: when forging, the game will draw the xBlade from the playerâ€™s storage xBlade before drawing xBlade from their wallet.
