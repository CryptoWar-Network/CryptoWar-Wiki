## World Theme : Story

Once upon a time, about 8,000 years ago, humanity suffered a great setback. Fire, Earth, Water, and Lightning - Once known as just a part of nature, then suddenly materialized as raging monsters roaming through the land. Their origins remained unknown to the people.

Facing powerful and aggressive beasts, humans retreated and scattered. Groups of humans settled across small corners of the world; in the quiet darkness of the forest, in the unforgivable coldness of the snow capped mountains, or isolated and solitude islands in the middle of the oceans. It was The Dark Age of humanity.

During this time, to protect their people from unexpected assaults of the monsters, the great elders of human tribes worked together to figure out a way to gain strengths. Everyone, from village chieftains to the alchemists to the wizards work together to seek a kind of power that can push back the army of the darkness. It takes humanity almost 2,000 years to The Age of Great Enlightenment when finally great human minds figured out a way to rein in the Elemental Power. From then, the tribes begin to train human heroes and produce magical and powerful weapons that are capable to fight against monsters.

There were wars everywhere when humanity tribes, one by one, standing up and battling with elemental beasts. Thousands of men and women died during this bloody period, villages were burned, families were torn. However, the human spirit ran high and the war between humanity and monsters come to balance during the next 3,000 years.

During the next 3,000 years, with wizardry advancements came The Age of Wizardry Progress, humanity started to gain upper hands versus natural beasts and began to build great settlements in larger lands with more populous cities. Social structures started to form. Trades took routes. Through out thousands of years of independent developments in bio-alchemic technology as well as casting magical wizardry powers upon new born. Humanity has separated into 4 large elemental races with distinct interests, biochemical features, and capabilities.

The people of Earth take interests into forestry and live in the deep of dark forest around the mountain ranges. The people of Fire are mostly agricultural societies, live in fertile low lands around the continent and use fire to help them achieve outstanding crop outcome every years. The people of Water are master of the trading routes. They navigate over the open seas and travel across complex rivers that connect different parts of the world to make profits from facilitating trades between different villages. Finally, the people of Lightning are the hermit of the world. Hide on top of the cold, unforgivable snow capped mountains and spend most of their time studying technology to achieve immortality and forever happiness.

The Age of Wizardry Progress brought prosperity to humanity and warfare progresses put the monsters back beyond boundaries of daily activities for most people. However, unequal prosperities and corrupted minds of wealthy tribe leaders have started to create cracks in the friendship between human races. Here and there, news about skirmishes across races of human that have death tolls up to thousands are spread around the continents. Besides, there are worrisome developments on the North where an entire tribe of Earth has been destroyed by a new, unknown type of monsters. Noone knews what happened. When the Water people went there for trades, they only see what remained after a bloody fight where noone survived.

It seems like The Age of Chaos has started to emerge ...
